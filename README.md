# ðŸ©º Web-Clinica 

Web-Clinica is a rebuild of the clinic management system I previously developed as my college capstone project. This new version aims to apply more modern web development practices, with better organization and improved user experience.  
The system is focused on appointment scheduling and patient management for small and medium-sized clinics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Rebuild the entire system from scratch using Next.js, aiming for better performance and a well-structured codebase.  
- Improve the architecture of the application, avoiding messy solutions and facilitating future maintenance.  
- Enhance the authentication system, appointment flow, and management of users and patients, with a focus on small clinics.  
- Prepare the foundation for future updates, such as potential integration with AI and WhatsApp messaging.

## ðŸ§± Planned Technologies

- **Next.js** â€” main framework
- **MySQL** â€” relational database
- **Tailwind CSS** â€” fast and modern styling
- **FullCalendar** â€” calendar and scheduling interface
- **Nodemailer** â€” automatic email sending
- **Node-cron** â€” task scheduler (e.g. for confirmation emails)
- Additional libraries will be added as needed

## ðŸ’¡ Planned Modules

- Authentication (Login and "Forgot password")
- Admin dashboard (patient and appointment registration)
- Appointment flow and interface validated by real doctors
- Calendar-integrated scheduling
- Automatic reminders and appointment confirmations via email
